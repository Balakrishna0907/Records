Step 1: Start the program.

Step 2: Define the base class Engine
  → Declare a protected data member engineCC (integer).
  → Define a public member function getEngineInfo() that:
   • Displays: "Enter Engine Capacity (in CC):"
   • Accepts user input for engineCC.

Step 3: Define the base class Body

   • Displays: "Enter Body Type (SUV/Sedan/Hatchback/etc):" and takes input for type.

Step 4: Define the derived class Car that inherits publicly from both Engine and Body.
  → Define a public member function showDetails() that:
   • Displays "--- Vehicle Information ---"
   • Displays engineCC, color, and type.

Step 5: In the main() function:
  1. Create an object obj of class Car.
  2. Call obj.getEngineInfo() to input engine details.
  3. Call obj.getBodyInfo() to input body details.
  4. Call obj.showDetails() to display all vehicle details.

Step 6: End the program.
